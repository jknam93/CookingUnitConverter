# CookingUnitConverter
Tired of american and UK cup/spoon measurement. This chrome extension plans to automatically convert them to Australian cup and spoon units(seriously, why does Australia have their own scale in the first place?)

## Ancillary Goals

* Convert from all directions i.e from Au/Us to UK, from Au, Uk to Us etc
* Automaticlaly adjust for portion i.e if a recipe serving 4 people needs 4 cup of water, automatically adjust volume to serving size of users choice thus a setting of 1 serving would convert the 4 cups to 1 cup.
*
